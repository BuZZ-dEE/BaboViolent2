Engine is now included into the BaboViolent2 solution. You don't need to build libraries 
separately anymore. Code is all together to make things simpler.

Only ProDebug configuration have been tested.
DX (DirectX) was an 'in progress' project, it might not compile or not show anything on screen.

Debug and Release are for the old (Pre-pro) version. You shall not try to compile those.
