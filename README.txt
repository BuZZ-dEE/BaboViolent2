Engine is already compiled and its libs placed inside BaboViolent2 folders.

Only ProDebug configuration have been tested.
DX (DirectX) was an 'in progress' project, it might not compile or not show anything on screen.

Debug and Release are for the old (Pre-pro) version. You shall not try to compile those.

If you wish to compile the engine, it might be a bit tricky because you need to follow
a certain order to compile them. And then compile dko and Babonet.
You also have to copy .h, .lib and .dll files as you modify them into the BaboViolent2 folders.
